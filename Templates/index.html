                medical examinations, medical treatments, medical diagnoses, medical evaluations and medical services. The right to health care is considered one of human rights with international human rights law as well as social security.A healthy
                person can think normally and act instantly according to the given situation. Healthy body is free from diseases and it doesnâ€™t leads to bulky body. Healthy mind is capable, positive and free thinking mind. Feeling of hunger comes from
                stem of brain. The part responsible for hunger and other basic motivated states is called as hypothalamus. It has sensors that literally taste the blood. They detect levels of fat, protein and glucose, as well as blood pressure and temperature.
                The hypothalamus gathers this data and combines it with sensory signals that percolate in through other systems in the brain, fullness in the gut, the feel and taste and smell of food, the sight of food, even the time of day and other
                surrounding circumstances.

                the symptom's user is observing in him/her. For that prediction we will apply a few machine learning models and pick the best fitted algorithm according to accuracy. Anyone can do it by sitting at their home and can get the list of doctors
                to whom they can consult. For this doctors list, we will do web scraping by beautiful soap. This project will make it easy for the user to consult the doctors of specific diseases otherwise users have to move from one doctor to another.In
                this website i.e. Symptomatic Assistance Website. This project involves both Machine Learning and Web Development Technologies. The project shows the prediction of the diseases which will be predicted by the symptoms entered by the user.
                The data used to predict the disease contains 133 symptoms and 41 diseases. To predict the appropriate disease, first, we will clean the data, then pre-process the data, do some analysis, train the model and apply that algorithm which
                gives the best accuracy for the machine learning model.
